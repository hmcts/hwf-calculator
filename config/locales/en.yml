        This calculator will tell you if you’re likely to get help with fees and how much you could get.
        You may be able to get money off the cost of a court or tribunal fee, or have the fee waived in full, if:
        You don't have much in savings, and
        You're receiving certain benefits, or
        You're on a low income
        If you have a partner, your partner's situation will also apply
      requirements_html: |
        What you’ll need
        You'll need information about your (and your partner's, if applicable):
        total savings amount, and
        either: list of benefits (or proof of certain benefits at the time you paid your fee)
        or: total monthly income
